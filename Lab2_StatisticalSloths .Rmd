* Question: How do class sizes impact a students performance in  school?

* 6 Months and 5 Years: 6 months after graduation I would like to be in graduate school getting my Phd in either Statistics or Political Science. Then in five years I would like to have graduated graduate school and be doing research for our government on education in the United States. 

* Greatest Career Accomplishment: I want to help make actual influential policy changes in the U.S.that could help future generations. 

* Learn in this course: How to analyze data and code out visuals that can be meaningful to people who are curious about a topic. 

* Creative: I am on the CU Triathlon Team!

  + Kevin's Feedback: I like how specific you are in describing what you want to do with your degree and where you want to be (working for the government on education issues). I think you could provide a little more background on your creative point. For example, do you have experience doing triathlons or is this something new you wanted to try?
  + Zandy's Feedback: I like your question because I am also curious if and how class sizes affect students. I would/ve liked if you were more specific on how you might use the tools in learned in this course or were more specific on what topics you might want to learn.
  + Katie's Feedback: I like how specific your information is and that it is clear how your post graduation goals and career accomplishment are related. I would've loved to see more information on what you are hoping to learn in this class. Are there certain topics that you would like to be able to analyze data for?

* Question: In football, when is it most beneficial for a team to try for a touchdown on fourth down rather than attempt a field goal?

* 6 Months: Six months after graduating I would like to be working in the sports industry in some capacity.
* 5 Years: Five years after graduating I would like to be working for a professional sports team using data science to help with roster building.

* Career Accomplishment: I hope my greatest career accomplishment will be working with and being a contributing piece on a championship winning sports team.

* In this course I hope to learn at least basic skills and tools in R that will help with data science tasks as I have no prior experience with this.

* Creative: I have always played some form of organized sport since I was three years old, including basketball, football, baseball, and track.

  + Madeline's Feedback: Your added info about enjoying sports made me wonder which sports teams you like.  
  + Zandy's Feedback: I like your after graduation and career goals to help build rosters for teams using statistics. I would've liked if you explained what sport you specifically might want to work in and specifically what team or teams you might want to work for.
  + Katie's Feedback: I like how you seperated your 6 months post graduation goal and 5 year goal and seeing how your first goal should stream into your 5 year goal. It would have been cool if you added what effects you would have on a sports team for your career accomplishment.

* Question: Do taller players in baseball have an advantage over less tall players?

* 6 months and 5 years: 6 months after graduation, I hope to be hired or just about to be hired in pursuit of my career and 5 years after graduation, I hope to be well experienced in my career/field.

* Greatest Career Accomplishment: To be able to help people out and solve real world problems with my knowledge in Statistics/Data Science and Economics.

* Learn in this Course: To learn to collaboratively work with a team and to better communicate with people in a team along with learning tools that will help me in my future career.

* Creative: I have been bowling since I was about 4 years old and bowl in bowling leagues and tournaments competitively.

  + Madeline's Feedback: Your fun fact about bowling was great. You talked about wanting to work in data science and I wondered which field. 
  + Kevin's Feedback: I like your question about height and how it relates to success in baseball. I am curious to know the answer as well, having played baseball for a long time myself. I think you could be more specific with what you would like to be doing after graduation, such as listing a specific field of work or a subject you are interested in working in if you have one.
  + Katie's Feedback: I really liked that in your career accomplishment you explained how you want to use your knowledge to help others. However, I feel you could have been more specific about this by including how your work with stats, data science and econ would contribute to solving real world problems.

* Question: Is it more likely for snowboarders to switch to skiing or for those who ski to switch to snowboarding?

* 6 Months and 5 Years: 6 months after graduation I want to be traveling while working on app development. 5 years after graduation I want to be working as a data scientist as well as have a fully working a developed app available to the world. 

* Greatest Career Accomplishment: I want to develop an app for skiing and snowboarding that would create an extra level of fun and creativity for those on the mountain.

* Learn in this Course: I want to learn more tools and aspects of R and how to apply those tools to correctly analyze data.

* Creative: I have been skiing since I was 2 but snowboarding has been my favorite thing to do for the past 10 years.

  + Madeline's Feedback: I think its really cool idea about combining snowboarding and app development, I noticed that you could include some team goals for this course.  
  + Zandy's Feedback: I like that you want to develop an app about snowboarding/skiiing because I am curious how the app would work. I would've liked if you talked about how you would use the tools learned in this class to, for instanse, develop your app.
  + Kevin's Feedback: I like that you know how you want to want to be an app developer and think it is cool that you want to incorporate your love of skiing and snowboarding into that. I think you could maybe go more in depth on your desire to travel by listing some specific places you are interested in seeing.
